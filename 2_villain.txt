As in any good story, there was a evil villain that had the only purpose of fucking things up for our beloved hero Mamba.
But will the villain succeed?
The villain had a really dangerous weapon, a magical copper coin.
At his side was his trusty pet giraffe, Bongo. Bongo had stuck with his master for many years, sharing in his evil master plans.
Bongo felt hatred boil up, focusing it on the hero as instructed by his master.
